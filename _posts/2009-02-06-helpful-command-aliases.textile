A great way to make your life using Git easier is to add aliases for commands that you use all the time into your @.gitconfig@ file. It might not be as elegant as adding shortcuts to your shell, but at least this will work consistently across all shells and is a breeze to set up. The "Git Cheat Sheet":http://cheat.errtheblog.com/s/git suggests adding this block to your config file:

<pre>
[alias]
  st = status
  ci = commit
  br = branch
  co = checkout
  df = diff
  lg = log -p
</pre>

Once you've got this block added to your config file, it should work immediately:

<pre>
$ git st
# On branch master
# Untracked files:
#   (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
#
#  _posts/2009-02-06-helpful-command-aliases.textile
nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
</pre>

You can also add aliases like so, and they will get added to your @.gitconfig@ file automatically.

<pre>
$ git config â€“-global alias.rb rebase
</pre>


For the SVN converts, Alex Soto has suggested a few alias helpers that will help with interacting with Subversion repositories:

<pre>
[alias]
  spull = !git-svn fetch && git-svn rebase
  spush = !git-svn dcommit
</pre>

There's also plenty of other advanced commands at the "GitWiki":http://git.or.cz/gitwiki/Aliases. If you've got an alias that others could find useful, comment or "submit":/submit.html away and it will be added!
