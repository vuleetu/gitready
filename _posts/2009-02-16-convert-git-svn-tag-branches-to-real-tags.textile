title: convert git-svn tag branches to real tags
category: advanced
---

This tip has been generously donated from "Alexis Midon":http://beardedmagnum.com. Thanks! His original post is "here":http://beardedmagnum.com/2009/02/15/converting-git-svn-tag-branches-to-real-tags/.

Alexis found out that in the process of converting from Subversion to Git, tags get a bit confused and show up as branches instead once converted over. This can be pretty inconvenient, especially when using @git branch@ since a ton of branches would show up such as @tag/1.2@, and so on. A little bit of scripting and Git magic can clear this up easily.

He followed the standard process for converting a svn repo:

<pre>
$ mkdir rails
$ cd rails 
$ git svn init -t tags -b branches -T trunk <path to svn repo>
Initialized empty Git repository in .git/
$ git svn fetch
</pre>

Next he whipped up a little script to convert all of the tag branches into "actual tags":http://gitready.com/beginner/2009/02/03/tagging.html, and then make sure they're deleted properly.

<pre>
$ git-for-each-ref refs/remotes/origin/tags | cut -d / -f 5- |
while read ref
do
git tag -a "$ref" -m"say farewell to SVN" "refs/remotes/origin/tags/$ref"
git push origin ":refs/heads/tags/$ref"
git push origin tag "$ref"
done
</pre>

If you've created scripts that help with converting over to Git from any other SCM, let us know in the comments or "submit your own tip!":http://gitready.com/submit.html
