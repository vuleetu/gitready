p=. This is a guest post from "Jo Liss":http://www.solitr.com/.

I picked up this trick to use Git as a kind of feed-reader on "Moro's blog":http://d.hatena.ne.jp/moro/20110719/1311048331, so I thought I'd share it here:

Let's say you want to stay up-to-date with a project - for example, an upstream repository you are contributing to, a smart developer you are trying to learn from, or an awesome library you'd just like to watch. How do you go about following the commits that are being pushed?

You _could_ use RSS feeds, such as the ones offered by GitHub:

But let's be honest: We would much rather read commits and diffs in the shell, like we are used to. (And as a bonus, we won't be assaulted by webcomics, pictures of kittens, and any number of other distractions our feed reader has in store for us.)

So instead, we display new commits with @git log@, and use Git's "lightweight tag system":http://book.git-scm.com/3_git_tag.html to place a "ribbon" marker tag that keeps track of how far we have read.

Simply add the following code to your @~/.gitconfig@:

<pre>
[alias]
    ribbon = tag --force _ribbon origin/master
    catchup = log --patch --reverse --topo-order _ribbon..origin/master
</pre>

Clone the project you want to watch, and type @git ribbon@ to initialize the ribbon marker.

Now whenever you fetch or pull, use @git catchup@ to read up on the latest changes in the @origin/master@ branch. After you are done reading, update the ribbon marker with @git ribbon@.

Sweet, isn't it?

By the way: If you do not like to read the individual commits in topic branches that were merged into @origin/master@, consider adding @--first-parent -m@ to the catchup log command.
